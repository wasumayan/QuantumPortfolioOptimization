# Quantum Portfolio Optimization with HHL++

This project showcases an enhanced quantum algorithm (HHL++) tailored for solving Linear Systems in the context of Portfolio Optimization. It combines traditional quantum techniques like Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) with novel enhancements such as hybrid eigenvalue inversion and fidelity benchmarking.

## Key Features

- **HHL++ Engine**: Modified HHL with improved inversion logic and preprocessing pipeline.
- **PortfolioQLSP**: Encodes portfolio optimization as a Quantum Linear System Problem.
- **Preprocessing Module**: Data is transformed using classical techniques to make it quantum-friendly.
- **Dynamic Fidelity Reporting**: Quantitative measure of how closely our quantum solution matches the classical benchmark.
- **Visualizations**: Plots that compare classical vs quantum amplitudes and illustrate measurement distributions.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare HHL++ with basic HHL and brute-force inversion for both performance and fidelity.

## Use Case

Quantum computers are uniquely suited to solve certain linear algebra problems exponentially faster. Portfolio Optimization—finding the best asset allocation to maximize return and minimize risk—can be reframed as solving a system Ax = b, where:

- **A**: Covariance matrix of assets (risk model)
- **b**: Encodes constraints, expected return, and budget

By encoding this into a quantum linear system and using HHL++, we:

- Reduce time complexity
- Enable high-speed decisions for high-frequency financial strategies
- Maintain or improve accuracy through our preprocessing and enhanced inversion

## Why Our Method is Better

| Method           | Fidelity ↑ | Depth ↓ | Runtime ↓ | Qubit Use |
|------------------|------------|---------|------------|------------|
| **HHL++ (ours)** | ✅ High     | ✅ Low  | ✅ Fast    | Moderate   |
| Vanilla HHL      | Medium     | High    | Slow       | High       |
| Classical Solver | Exact      | N/A     | Slow       | None       |

- We preprocess A and b for better conditioning
- Use hybrid inversion for numerical stability
- Fidelity computation isolates signal from noise (only ancilla = 1)
